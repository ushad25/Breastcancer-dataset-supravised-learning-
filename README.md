# Brestcancer-dataset-supravised-learning-
it is an assessment on the breast cancer dataset using supervised learning techniques. 
Formative Assessment: Supervised Learning
Student:Usha
Date: 8 Jul
Due: 21 Jul
Points: 10

Objective:
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate your understanding and ability to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset.

Dataset:
Use the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.
1. Loading and Preprocessing (2 marks)
Task: Load the breast cancer dataset from sklearn. Preprocess the data to handle any missing values and perform necessary feature scaling.

Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing values; none were found.
Feature Scaling: Used StandardScaler to standardize feature values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is essential as many machine learning algorithms perform better with standardized data.

3. Classification Algorithm Implementation (5 marks)
Implement the following five classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
For each algorithm, provide a brief description of how it works and why it might be suitable for this dataset.
